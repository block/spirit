// Subscription is now an interface! It defines how the replication changes are tracked.
// We have two strategies:
// 1. Delta Map: The OG, works only with memory comparable primary keys. Tracks the PK and if the last operation was a delete or not.
// 2. Delta Queue: A queue of changes, works with any primary key type. Does not effectively de-deplucate intermediate changes and must be replayed in order.
// 3. Buffered: A version of delta map that doesn't use REPLACE INTO .. SELECT.

	HasChanged(key, row []any, deleted bool)

	Tables() []*table.TableInfo // returns the tables related to the subscription in currentTable, newTable order
